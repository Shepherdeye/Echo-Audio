# Echo App - Arabic Speech Processing


The Echo App is a React-based application designed to process Arabic speech using RDIâ€™s Kateb (Speech-to-Text) and Natiq (Text-to-Speech) APIs. It allows users to record audio, upload files, transcribe speech to text, and generate echoed speech with word highlighting.
